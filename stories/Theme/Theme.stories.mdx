# Theme

The purpose of this component is changing theme. It provides two themes: `light` and `dark`. The light theme is used by default.

If you have read the source code of this repository, you can find that almost all styles use CSS variables. There are two ways to change theme: global and scoped. No matter which way, they will modify color-related CSS variables by adding CSS class name. Global way will add CSS class name to the `<html>` element. Scoped way will add CSS class name to the child element.

## Examples

### Global

The first button in the document toolbar is used to change global theme, you can click it to try.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Theme } from "@lilib/ui";

function Root() {
  return <Theme value="dark" />;
}
// Or
function Root() {
  return <Theme value="dark">...</Theme>;
}
```

### Scoped

If the `scoped` prop is specified to `true`, the `children` prop must be a React element that accepts `className` prop.

<Canvas mdxSource={require("!!raw-loader!./Scoped").default}>
  <Story id="examples-theme--scoped" />
</Canvas>

### Nested

<Canvas mdxSource={require("!!raw-loader!./Nested").default}>
  <Story id="examples-theme--nested" />
</Canvas>

### Sync with system

You can change the system theme mode to see the effect.

<Canvas mdxSource={require("!!raw-loader!./SyncWithSystem").default}>
  <Story id="examples-theme--sync-with-system" />
</Canvas>

## Props

| Property   | Type                            | Description                  | Default |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------- |
| `scoped`   | `boolean`                       | Scoped theme                 | `false` |
| `value`    | `null` \| `"light"` \| `"dark"` | Theme value                  | `null`  |
| `children` | `ReactElement` \| `ReactNode`   | Child element or child nodes | -       |

The `scoped` prop is used to distinguish between different ways to change the theme. When `scoped` is `true`, the Theme component is scoped, and the `children` prop must be a React element. Otherwise, it is global, and the `children` can be any React nodes.

The Theme component will not add CSS class names by default, they will be added only if you specify the `value` prop to `"light"` or `"dark"`. If the `value` props is `null` or `undefined`, all theme class names added before will be cleared.
